The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm.
It assigns variable-length codes to input characters,
with shorter codes for more frequent characters.

This sample text contains repeated words and phrases
to give the compressor something to work on.
Feel free to replace it with any other plain-text content
â€” poems, logs, source code, whatever you like!

Once saved, run:
    python compress.py my_text.txt my_text.huff
then:
    python decompress.py my_text.huff my_text_restored.txt
